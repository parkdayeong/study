            1.JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex
            functionalities on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and
            display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates,
            interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

            2.JavaScript is arguably more difficult <br />to learn than related technologies such as
            HTML and CSS. Before attempting to learn JavaScript, you are strongly advised to get
            familiar with at least these two technologies first, t <br />and perhaps others as well.
            Start by working through the following modules:

            After getting familiar with the basics of JavaScript, you should be in a position to
            learn about more advanced topics, for example:

            4.JavaScript is an actively evolving language t <br />and has changed greatly over the
            years. In particular, the 6th edition of the language (sometimes known as ECMAScript
            2015 or ES6), introduced in 2015, added many new features.t <br />
            At the same time, to maintain backwardst <br />
            compatibility with older websites, old featurest <br />
            of the language have been retained,t <br />
            even when they are no longer considered good practice.
